Spring Boot Application:
------------------------


🔍 Why Spring Boot?
Traditional Spring Application Setup is complex:
-> Manual collection of required JAR files
-> Managing compatibility versions
-> Configuration overhead (XMLs, Java config)

✅ Spring Boot simplifies this with:
-> Auto-configuration
-> Embedded server (Tomcat/Jetty)
-> Pre-configured starter dependencies
-> Easy setup via Spring Initializr or STS


Ways to Create SpringBoot Project:-->

🌐 1. Creating Spring Boot Project – via Spring Initializr (Online Tool)
✅ Steps:
1. Go to: https://start.spring.io
2. Fill project metadata:
-> Project: Maven/Gradle
-> Language: Java
-> Spring Boot Version (Recommended stable version)
-> Group ID, Artifact ID, Name, Description
-> Packaging: Jar/War
-> Java Version
3. Add Dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, JPA, Thymeleaf, etc.)
4. Click on Generate
5. A ZIP file will be downloaded.
6. Extract the ZIP.
7. Open Eclipse:
-> File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Project
-> Select the root folder (contains pom.xml)
-> Click Finish
🚀 Your project is ready. Start coding inside the main application class!

💡 Notes:
-> By default, Spring Boot comes with core modules.
-> All required JARs are auto-included via Spring Boot Starter dependencies.
-> Includes support for:
        -> Logging: log4j.jar / slf4j
        -> Unit testing: junit.jar
        -> Auto-configuration support


🧰 2. Creating Spring Boot Project via STS Plugin in Eclipse
Steps:
1. Install STS Plugin:
-> Go to: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tools-4-aka-spring-tool-suite-4
-> Install in Eclipse
-> Restart Eclipse after installation

2. Create Spring Boot App:
-> File -> New -> Project -> Spring Boot -> Spring Starter Project
-> Fill project details
-> Select dependencies
-> Finish
🧩 Project is auto-configured and ready for development.


🖥️ 3. Using STS IDE (Spring Tool Suite)
What is STS?
-> A customized version of Eclipse built for Spring development.
Combines:
-> Eclipse IDE
-> Spring Boot support
-> Embedded wizards for quick project creation
Steps:
1. Download STS:
-> Spring Tool Suite Download Link (https://cdn.spring.io/spring-tools/release/STS4/4.26.0.RELEASE/dist/e4.33/spring-tool-suite-4-4.26.0.RELEASE-e4.33.0-win32.win32.x86_64.zip)
2. Extract the ZIP
3.Launch STS (same UI as Eclipse)
4.Create a Project:
-> File -> New -> Spring Starter Project
-> Enter project details, dependencies
-> Click Finish
✅ Project is set up and ready.
