IOC(Inversion of Control) Principal :
Spring Framework is build with one of the Principal called IOC.

The IoC (Inversion of Control) principle is a design pattern that reverses the flow of control in an application. 
Instead of objects controlling their dependencies, 
the control is handed over to a container or framework (in this case, Springâ€™s IoC Container).


Dependency Injection (DI):
DI is one of the most common techniques to achive IoC.
In DI, an objects dependencies are injected into it by an external entity rather than the object creating its own dependencies.

Creating Spring Application:
-----------------------------
-> No Need to install any Software in Computer.
Spring Framework -> Always comes a group of JAR Files

JAR File:
---------
Java Archive File / Compressing / Zip


Spring 2003: Version 1
Spring 2024 : Spring 6

1. Get Spring File
2. Create java project
3. Identify Spring jar Files which are asscoiated to Spring Core Module
            spring-beans-5.3.9
			spring-context-5.3.9
			spring-core-5.3.9
			spring-expression-5.3.9
4. Setup class path/build path of the jar File from step 3.

Right click on project -> Build path -> Configure build path -> libraries -> select class path 
->  Spring Project setup complted. 


Once classes are created, then we have to provide Class information to Spring Framework
Configuration of infromation -> Spring Framework -> Class -> Creating Object. 

100 % spring Framework coding is start.
