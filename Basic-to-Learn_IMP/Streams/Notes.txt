Stream:
In Java, Stream API (introduced in Java 8) is used to process collections (like Lists, Sets, Maps) in a functional style. 
It allows operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing data with less code and better performance.

Key Features of Streams:
✅ Functional Programming → Uses lambda expressions.
✅ Lazy Execution → Operations are executed only when needed.
✅ Parallel Processing → Supports parallel streams for faster execution.
✅ No Modification → Streams don’t modify the original data.
