Q. How to Configure Instance Variable Values for Each Object in Spring?
-> In Spring, values for instance variables can be configured using Dependency Injection (DI).
-> When an object is created by the Spring Container, the values are set automatically.
-> This can be done using Setter Injection, Constructor Injection, or Field Injection.

Q. Ways to Inject Dependencies in Spring
XML-based Configuration:
-> Setter Injection (Using <property> in XML)
-> Constructor Injection (Using <constructor-arg> in XML)
-> Field Injection (Less common in XML, mainly used in annotations)

Annotation-based Configuration:
-> @Autowired (for Field Injection)
-> @Autowired + Setter method (for Setter Injection)
-> @Autowired + Constructor (for Constructor Injection)

Q. Understanding Setter Injection
Definition: Spring injects values via setter methods.
Process:
-> The Spring container checks if a setter method exists for the property.
-> If the setter method exists, the value is passed to the method.
-> The property gets assigned.

Example:
(XML Configuration) ->
{
<bean id="e1" class="com.dilip.it.Employee">
    <property name="empId" value="100"/>
    <property name="empName" value="Dilip"/>
</bean>

<bean id="e2" class="com.dilip.it.Employee">
    <property name="empId" value="150"/>
    <property name="empName" value="Suresh"/>
</bean>
}

Java Class ->
{
    public class Employee {
    private int empId;
    private String empName;

    public void setEmpId(int empId) {
        this.empId = empId;
    }

    public void setEmpName(String empName) {
        this.empName = empName;
    }
}

}

Types of Dependency Injection (DI) in XML Configuration:
In Spring XML configuration, there are three main types of Dependency Injection (DI):

Setter Injection:
-> Spring injects values into the bean properties using setter methods.
-> Uses the <property> tag in XML.

Constructor Injection:
-> Spring injects values into the bean properties using constructor parameters.
-> Uses the <constructor-arg> tag in XML.

Field Injection (Not common in XML, mainly used in annotations):
-> Directly injects values into fields.
-> Mainly used in annotations (@Autowired), but possible in XML using p-namespace.
